    ## Contributing Official Sets
    If you find an officially released set that is not listed here, or one that is widely acknowledged by the community, you can contribute it to the `data/candidates` folder. Please follow these steps:
    
    1. Place the set file in the `data/candidates` folder.
    2. Ensure the file name is descriptive and includes the set name.
    3. Submit a pull request or notify a maintainer for review.
    
    **Note**: These contributions should only include officially released sets or sets that are recognized by the community, not custom user-created sets.
